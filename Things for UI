GUI needs button / some way for the user to:
	- Game Play
		- Step / Pause (depending on what we decide)
		- Operator Name
		- Controlling components
			- Set valve (on/off)
			- Set Pump RPM (or pump on off (probably not both))
			- Set controll rod level
		- Repairing components
			- Pumps
			- Turbine
	- Things to display
		- Reactor: stats ( Health, water level, temp, pressure, mins an maxes of these possibly)
		- Condenser: (same as above)
		- Pumps: RPM and whether functional
		- Valves: Position
		- Turbine: RPM and functionality
		- Control Rod Level
	- Other things for user to be able to do
		- New Game
		- Save Game
		- Load Game
		- High Scores (view in some way)
		- Close
	- Game over screen
			
			
- Notes on UI Design
	- As the health of reactor and condenser are not shown unless you click on them to display their stats, maybe whent their helth gets low a warning picture comes up? "WARNING! LOW COMPONENT HEALTH" or something?
	  Then go to game over screen when one reaches 0?
	- Possibly rename gameView to GUI or GameView? I think GUI as that makes it conform to the original TextUI naming.
